The problem was that neither was all that\n                appealing. One would likely cause everyone a huge amount of\n                physical pain while the other would likely end up with everyone\n                in jail. In Sam's mind, there was only one thing to do. He threw\n                everyone else under the bus and he secretly sprinted away\n                leaving the others to take the fall without him. The shoes had\n                been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was\n                difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first\n                appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there and yet they\n                seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a\n                question that had been asked time and again, but while they all\n                thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it.\n                So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense,\n                but perfectly normal in another. Things aren't going well at all\n                with mom today. She is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all\n                the time. I sure hope that things get better soon. Dragons don't\n                exist they said. They are the stuff of legend and people's\n                imagination. Greg would have agreed with this assessment without\n                a second thought 24 hours ago. But now that there was a dragon\n                staring directly into his eyes, he questioned everything that he\n                had been told. They argue. While the argument seems to be\n                different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the topic may\n                be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done,\n                it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but\n                neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying\n                issue. So they continue to argue. All he wanted was a candy bar.\n                It didn't seem like a difficult request to comprehend, but the\n                clerk remained frozen and didn't seem to want to honor the\n                request. It might have had something to do with the gun pointed\n                at his face. “Ingredients for life,” said the backside of the\n                truck. They mean food, but really food is only 1 ingredient of\n                life. Life has so many more ingredients such as pain, happiness,\n                laughter, joy, tears, and smiles. Life also has hard work, easy\n                play, sleepless nights, and sunbathing by the ocean. Love,\n                hatred, envy, self-assurance, and fear could be just down aisle\n                3 ready to be bought when needed. How I wish I could pull\n                ingredients like these off shelves in a store. He read about a\n                hike called the incline in the guidebook. It said it was a\n                strenuous hike and to bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike\n                to the clouds” described one review. “Not for the\n                faint-hearted,” said another. “Not too bad of a workout”,\n                bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike it when I fly in from\n                Maryland on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness\n                conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so I\n                could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was\n                for a 70-year-old low-lander. The chair sat in the corner where\n                it had been for over 25 years. The only difference was there was\n                someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since\n                someone had done that? Ten years or more he imagined. Yet there\n                was no denying the presence in the chair now. You know that\n                tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I\n                just got that feeling when talking with her. You know I don't\n                believe in sixth senses, but there is something not right with\n                her. I don't know how I know, but I just do. \"It was so great to\n                hear from you today and it was such weird timing,\" he said.\n                \"This is going to sound funny and a little strange, but you were\n                in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I'd love to get\n                together and tell you about it if you're up for a cup of\n                coffee,\" he continued, laying the trap he'd been planning for\n                years. The river slowly meandered through the open space. It had\n                hidden secrets that it didn't want to reveal. It had a\n                well-planned strategy to appear calm, inviting, and appealing.\n                That's how the river lured her unknowing victims to her water's\n                edge. He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent\n                from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult.\n                What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the\n                same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the\n                inevitable consequences, but he wasn't. The headache wouldn't go\n                away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. The\n                monstrous throbbing in her head continued. She had this happen\n                to her only once before in her life and she realized that only\n                one thing could be happening. He slowly poured the drink over a\n                large chunk of ice he has especially chiseled off a larger\n                block. He didn't particularly like his drinks cold, but he knew\n                that the drama of chiseling the ice and then pouring a drink\n                over it looked far more impressive than how he actually liked\n                it. It was all about image and he'd managed to perfect the image\n                that he wanted to project. They had always called it the green\n                river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had\n                a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and\n                had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise\n                that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink. You're\n                going to make a choice today that will have a direct impact on\n                where you are five years from now. The truth is, you'll make\n                choice like that every day of your life. The problem is that on\n                most days, you won't know the choice you make will have such a\n                huge impact on your life in the future. So if you want to end up\n                in a certain place in the future, you need to be careful of the\n                choices you make today. Dave watched as the forest burned up on\n                the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been\n                hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last\n                of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most\n                important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind.\n                He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in\n                advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was\n                needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets,\n                but she still was nowhere to be seen. He swung back the fishing\n                pole and cast the line which ell 25 feet away into the river.\n                The lure landed in the perfect spot and he was sure he would\n                soon get a bite. He never expected that the bite would come from\n                behind in the form of a bear. Then came the night of the first\n                falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over\n                Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.\n                Hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling\n                star. It seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles\n                east of him. After hunting for several hours, we finally saw a\n                large seal sunning itself on a flat rock. I took one of the\n                wooden clubs while Larry took the longer one. We slowly snuck up\n                behind the seal until we were close enough to club it over its\n                head. The seal slumped over and died. This seal would help us\n                survive. We could eat the meat and fat. The fat could be burned\n                in a shell for light and the fur could be used to make a\n                blanket. We declared our first day of hunting a great success.\n                One can cook on and with an open fire. These are some of the\n                ways to cook with fire outside. Cooking meat using a spit is a\n                great way to evenly cook meat. In order to keep meat from\n                burning, it's best to slowly rotate it. Hot stones can be used\n                to toast bread. Coals are hot and can bring things to a boil\n                quickly. If one is very adventurous, one can make a hole in the\n                ground, fill it with coals and place foil-covered meat, veggies,\n                and potatoes into the coals, and cover all of it with dirt. In a\n                short period of time, the food will be baked. Campfire cooking\n                can be done in many ways. There was no time. He ran out of the\n                door without half the stuff he needed for work, but it didn't\n                matter. He was late and if he didn't make this meeting on time,\n                someone's life may be in danger. \"It doesn't take much to touch\n                someone's heart,\" Daisy said with a smile on her face. \"It's\n                often just the little things you do that can change a person's\n                day for the better.\" Daisy truly believed this to be the way the\n                world worked, but she didn't understand that she was merely a\n                robot that had been programmed to believe this. The headphones\n                were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her\n                mom yelling in the background, but couldn't make out exactly\n                what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put\n                them on. She knew her mom would enter her room at any minute,\n                and she could pretend that she hadn't heard any of the previous\n                yelling. Barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty\n                minutes. it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes. David\n                had promised that he would be on time today. He never was, but\n                he had promised this one time. She had made him repeat the\n                promise multiple times over the last week until she'd believed\n                his promise. Now she was paying the price. She was in a hurry.\n                Not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to get someplace,\n                but a frantic hurry. The type of hurry where a few seconds could\n                mean life or death. She raced down the road ignoring speed\n                limits and weaving between cars. She was only a few minutes away\n                when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead. I\n                don’t like cats and they don’t like me. I used to be allergic to\n                them and I would get stuffed up and have hives. That doesn’t\n                seem to happen anymore. But I still don’t like them. I lived\n                with 3 cats that were not good at peeing in the litter box. They\n                seemed to find something important to me and pee on it. Most of\n                the time they peed on photographs or papers that would be\n                ruined. Cats also bring fleas into the house. There is nothing\n                worse than having to flea dip cats and also flea bomb a home.\n                That is why I don’t like cats.\n              </p>\n            )}\n          </div>\n        </article>\n        <div className=\"interaction-row\">\n          <span className=\"interaction-btn like\">\n            <MdThumbUpOffAlt />\n            <span>237</span>\n          </span>\n          <span className=\"interaction-btn comment\">\n            <MdOutlineModeComment />\n            <span>237</span>\n          </span>\n          <span className=\"interaction-btn share\">\n            <MdOutlineShare />\n          </span>\n        </div>\n        {preview ? null : (\n          <>\n            <br />\n            <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n              <CommentSection />\n            </Suspense>\n          </>\n        )}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
